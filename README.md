RxFsm is a hierarchical finite state machine (FSM) library built on top of RxJava. 
Although (not yet) feature complete, the FSM implementation adheres to the UML state 
machine notation and strives to implement the semantics outlined in "Practical UML 
Statecharts in C/C++, 2nd Edition" by Miro Samek (which is a must read for those 
interested in the subject).

## Examples
See unit tests for examples (FsmTests.java) and an illustration of supported features.

## TODO
- Generate SCXML from FSM
- Transition to history
- Improved documentation
- More examples
- Orthogonal regions
